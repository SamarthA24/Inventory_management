# Build a Fullstack Inventory Management Dashboard
An Inventory Management System is a software application designed to track and manage the flow of goods within an organization. It helps businesses efficiently monitor stock levels, manage orders, and prevent overstocking or stockouts. The system automates key inventory processes, providing real-time data on stock availability, order status, and product movement.

This system aims to streamline inventory operations by offering features such as:
✅ Stock Tracking: Monitors inventory levels and updates them in real-time.
✅ Order Management: Manages purchase orders and sales orders.
✅ Supplier and Customer Management: Keeps track of supplier and customer details.
✅ Reporting and Analytics: Generates detailed reports on stock levels, turnover rates, and sales performance.
✅ Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts for low stock levels or delayed deliveries.
